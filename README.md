MongoDB_PowerShell
===================

MongoDB_PowerShell is a series of PowerShell scripts to assist Windows developers starting out with MongoDB (like yours truly, [Bishopsmove](http:twitter.com/Bishops_move))



Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/bishopsmove/MongoDB_PowerShell.git`


Future efforts
-----------

I will probably add to the help HTML generator to compile a help micro-site. Also looking at some DevOps-style scripts to manage, import, backup the datastore.
If you have 'better' ideas or found this good enough, send me a Tweet and let me know. 

If you thought this was lousy or otherwise unnecessary, consider this a challenge to keep it to yourself.
